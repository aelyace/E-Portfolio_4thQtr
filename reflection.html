<p style="font-family:Courier; font-size:20; background-color:#ffe8d9;" align="center"> I can't believe it. It's almost the end of the school year. Being a grade 9 student taugh me so many valuable lessons. It taught me the true value of friendship, it taught me how to face my fears, and most importantly, it taught me how to cooperate and socialize with my peers. Most of us would certinly agree, yes, ICT wasn't one of the classes we could simply just say "Oh, it's so easy!", we had to study hard, and help each other to strive. All of us faced multiple challenges, but there was never one we didn't face together. Before I say goodbye to this school year, I would like to thank our ICT teacher, you, Miss Uminga. Thank you for always being so patient and understanding with us. Thank you for always trying and not giving up on us no matter what happened. I know that it hasn't been easy dealing with us because we were always very "makulit", but that didn't stop you for teaching. Miss Uminga, you were one of the most memorable teachers we have ever encountered. I hope that the next students treat you well, and we hope that you'll always have that passion for teaching. I have been very blessed with the countless memories and friends I made these past months. I will never forget all of the hard work and efforts we have made. I hope everyone's dreams and passions may all come true in the future. See you next time, everyone.
